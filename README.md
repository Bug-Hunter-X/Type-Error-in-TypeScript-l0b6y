This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type error. The program defines a function `greeter` that takes a string as an argument and returns a string. However, when the program attempts to call the function with an array of strings, it causes a type error. The solution demonstrates how to fix this type error by using type assertions or by changing the function signature to accept an array of strings.
